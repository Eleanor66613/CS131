# python is a scripting languages.
# it doesn't have compiler
# it is a small programs that links the other big programs to do something
# any dynamically types languages
# language features tailored to writing scripts
#  -little programs that connect other programs
#  regular expression matching
# easy manipulation of text data / files
# ability to invoke processes
# lots of libraries for common functionality
# memory safe
tuple:
t = (1,'hi', True)
t[1];
t[2];
t[3];

list:
l = [1,2,3]
l = [1, 'hi', True]
l[2] = "hello"
# can mutipulate the list

l.len() XXX
len(l)
# convertion routines
s = '345'
int(s) 
list(s)
tuple(s)

def prodList(l):
	result = 1
	for i in l:
		result *= i
	return result

#indention is very important

# why have both tuple and list in python?
